                  We believe all of our employees can learn from each other!
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have created this system to ease the mentoring process! Our mentoring programme assigns a "newcomer" to somebody experienced so they can learn the ropes
                  from them. This way our systems and protocols are properly known by everybody, and new employees get to know senior employees!
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Senior employees can also learn from newcomers! It is exactly the same process, and this assures an influx of new informations and practices in our company.
